# Apple Quality Data
## Overview
This dataset contains information on various attributes of apples and their corresponding quality rating. 
The attributes include size, weight, sweetness, crunchiness, juiciness, ripeness, and acidity. This data is useful for analyzing and predicting apple quality based on its attributes.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

1. A_id: Unique identifier for each apple.
2. Size: Size of the apple (normalized).
3. Weight: Weight of the apple (normalized).
4. Sweetness: Sweetness level of the apple (normalized).
5. Crunchiness: Crunchiness level of the apple (normalized).
6. Juiciness: Juiciness level of the apple (normalized).
7. Ripeness: Ripeness level of the apple (normalized).
8. Acidity: Acidity level of the apple (normalized).
9. Quality: Quality rating of the apple (good/bad).

## Learning outcomes
This dataset is primarily suited for:

Supervised Learning:
Classification tasks, where the goal is to predict the Quality of an apple based on its attributes (Size, Weight, Sweetness, etc.).

## Data Source
